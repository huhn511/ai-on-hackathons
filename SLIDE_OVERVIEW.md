## üéÆ The Authentic Demo Story

### Core Demonstration
**Tool Used**: Google Gemini CLI  
**Goal**: Build Flappy Bird web game  
**Method**: Conversational programming (natural language prompts)  
**Result**: Complete playable game in ~10 minutes  

### The 3 Prompts (Actual)
1. **"Build a simple copy of the game 'Flappy Bird' as a web version"**
   - Generated complete HTML/CSS/JS game
   - Working physics, collision detection, game loop
   - Basic graphics that needed improvement

2. **"the graphics are not real, create own graphics"** 
   - Improved visual design
   - Custom bird and pipe graphics
   - Better game aesthetics

3. **"the game is currently very hard to play"**
   - Balanced difficulty level
   - Smoother gameplay mechanics
   - Actually fun and playable

### Key Learning Points
- **Reality Check**: Better initial context could have avoided some iterations
- **Beauty of AI**: Easy to iterate and improve through conversation
- **No Restart Needed**: Each prompt builds on the previous result
- **Production Ready**: Generated 150+ lines of working JavaScript

### Generated Files
- `demo/index.html` - Game structure
- `demo/style.css` - Game styling  
- `demo/script.js` - 150+ lines of game logic
- `demo/prompt.md` - The actual 3 prompts used

## üé® Design Decisions & Technical Context

### Styling Approach
- **Inline CSS**: Used throughout for Slidev compatibility
- **Mixed with some Tailwind**: Only in author and conclusion slides  
- **Reason**: Consistent rendering across different Slidev environments
- **Color Scheme**: Cyan (#4EC5D4), green (#10B981), purple (#A855F7), orange (#fb923c)

### Video Integration  
- **Location**: `public/video/` for Slidev access
- **Format**: MP4 with HTML5 video controls
- **Sizing**: 70-80% width for optimal viewing
- **Styling**: Border radius and shadow for visual appeal

### Timeline Design
- **Chronological Accuracy**: 1966 isolated at 15%, 2022-2025+ clustered at 65-85%
- **Visual Elements**: Colored dots on horizontal line
- **Message**: Shows AI winter followed by recent AI spring
- **Text Sizes**: Reduced to prevent overlapping (1.5em emojis, 0.9em years)

### File Structure
- **Modular**: Each slide in separate `.md` file
- **Imports**: Main `slides.md` uses `src:` to include slide files
- **Images**: Mix of local files and Unsplash URLs for transitions
- **Videos**: Moved from `demo/video/` to `public/video/` for Vite compatibility

## ü§ñ Guidance for Future AI Agents

### Core Themes to Maintain
1. **Developer Focus**: This is for makers and builders, not business audiences
2. **Authentic Demo**: The Gemini CLI story is real and should remain authentic
3. **Conversational Programming**: Emphasize natural language as the future interface
4. **Practical Tools**: Focus on tools developers can actually use today

### Content Principles
- **No Business Metrics**: Avoid revenue, time savings, ROI discussions
- **Real Examples**: Use actual tools, real prompts, genuine results
- **Technical Depth**: Developers want to understand how things work
- **Future Vision**: Show where technology is heading (2027+ natural language programming)

### Technical Considerations
- **Video Compatibility**: Videos must be in `public/video/` for Slidev
- **CSS Approach**: Prefer inline styles over complex Tailwind for stability
- **Slide Transitions**: Use `layout: cover` with background images between content
- **Demo Files**: Keep the actual generated game files as proof of concept

### Key Messages Never to Change
- **"USB-C for AI"**: MCP protocol description
- **"3 prompts ‚Üí Complete game"**: Demo statistics  
- **"We just built a game by talking to a computer"**: Conversational programming power
- **"AI agents are tools, not competitors"**: Collaborative relationship with AI

### Author Context
- **Sebastian Heu√üer**: STACKIT employee, Gov Tech Ambassador
- **Passionate Developer**: Loves tech and nature, builds future one line at a time
- **Hackathon Enthusiast**: Vibe coded the hackathon landing page
- **Authentic Voice**: Technical writer who speaks developer-to-developer
